#states-countify

__Each file is a state (USA) composed of its counties rendered entirely in GeoJSON format.__

Thanks to @johan's [world.geo.json repo](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json), I was able to compile all of the county multipolygons for each respective state.
Clone and use as you wish.  I'd love to see what projects you work on given the data!
